## individual mod descriptions
### bike indoors.rb
- just a fun mod that lets you bike indoors, because why not
### exp to level cap.rb
- any amount of exp gain will send you straight to the level cap
- Pokemon can evolve multiple times at the end of a battle if they satisfy the conditions so you don't get stuck with a second-stage evolution at the level cap (it'll stop trying to evolve it if you cancel the evolution once)
- holding X during the exp gain sequence will skip the popup window as well as the "\[Pokemon\] gained X exp!" message
### instant bars.rb
- HP and EXP bars move instantly
### perma repel.rb
- you can't encounter wild Pokemon unless you're holding the spacebar
### relearn hidden egg moves.rb
- fully evolved delta Pokemon holding their corresponding type plate will be able to learn their hidden egg move via the move relearner menu instead of needing to breed
